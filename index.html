    <h2>GitHub Codespaces</h2>
    <p>
      The codespaces environment is available free for _small_ projects, but only one at a time. This one is hosted and paid for by the "Team" you are in for class. That allows you to have multiple codespaces - one for each repository!
    </p>
    <p>There are certain limitations but it is improving all the time.</p>
    <p>
      Play around in here, try to run the node-script.js file, preview the
      index.html file, and maybe commit your changes.
